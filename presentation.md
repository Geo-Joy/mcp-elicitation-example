# MCP Elicitation
## The Future of AI-Human Collaboration

*Transforming AI interactions from static exchanges to dynamic, context-aware conversations*

---

<!-- _class: lead -->

## Imagine This Scenario

You're deploying a critical application with AI assistance...

Halfway through, it needs your **AWS credentials**

---

<!-- _class: lead -->

## Or This One

AI customer support tool helping a user...

Suddenly realizes it needs to know **which device** they're using

---

## The Problem

Until recently, these scenarios would **break the flow**

- 🔄 Restart conversations
- 📋 Copy-paste information  
- 🛠️ Build complex workarounds

---

## Introducing

# **MCP Elicitation**

*The breakthrough that changes everything*

---

## What is MCP Elicitation?

**Dynamic information requests from AI systems**
- At runtime
- While maintaining security
- With user control

---

## Before vs After

**Before:** AI was stuck with initial information

**Now:** AI can dynamically ask for exactly what it needs, when it needs it

---

## Perfect Analogy

**Vending Machine**
- Only takes exact change
- Limited interaction

**vs.**

**Digital Interface**
- Guides your purchase
- Asks preferences
- Handles complexity

---

## The Old Problem

AI systems were **isolated islands**

When they needed more context, developers had to:
- Build custom tooling for every interaction
- Use brittle multi-step tool calls
- Create proprietary protocols
- Over-engineer prompts

---

## The Result?

**Fragmented, inconsistent, and often broken user experiences**

---

# How It Works

---

## Technical Flow

1. 🚀 Start conversation with AI
2. 🔧 AI calls tools/agents
3. 🤔 Agent needs more information
4. 📋 Generates structured form
5. 📤 Form sent to user
6. ✏️ User fills out requirements
7. ✅ Agent continues with perfect context

---

## The Magic: "Structured"

Not clunky chatbot responses like:
*"Please provide your email"*

**Instead:** Proper form interfaces with:
- ✨ Validation
- 📝 Descriptions  
- 🎯 Smart defaults

---

## Three-Action Response

- **✅ Accept:** User provides information
- **❌ Decline:** User rejects request
- **⏹️ Cancel:** User dismisses

Clear signals for both users and servers

# Why Should You Care?

---

## Old Way: Letters vs Phone Calls

**Traditional AI interactions:**
- Write everything you think AI might need
- Send it off and hope for the best
- Missing something? **Start over**

---

## Real Workflows Are Different

- 🌀 **Messy**
- 🔄 **Iterative**
- 💬 **Require back-and-forth**

---

## The Real Power

**Conversational workflows** that feel natural but are structured enough to be reliable

AI guides users through complex processes while maintaining context

---

# Real-World Examples

---

## Customer Support

**Customer:** "My app keeps crashing"

**AI:** *detects missing device info*

**AI:** Shows device selection form

**Customer:** Selects iPhone 15, iOS 17.2

**AI:** "Here are specific steps for your device..."

---

## DevOps Workflow

**Developer:** "Deploy staging environment"

**AI:** *needs deployment config*

**AI:** Shows form with region, instance type, etc.

**Developer:** Fills out parameters

**AI:** Proceeds with exact specifications

---

## Data Analysis

**Analyst:** "Generate sales report"

**AI:** *needs date range and filters*

**AI:** Shows date picker and department filters

**Analyst:** Sets parameters

**AI:** Generates precise report

---

## Enterprise Approvals

**AI-assisted budget approvals:**

1. 📋 Collects request details
2. 🔍 Determines approval chain
3. 📝 Requests justification if needed
4. 🎯 Routes to managers
5. 🔄 Handles revisions

# The Transformation

---

## From Static to Dynamic

**Before:** Vending machine approach
- Put in request
- Hope you included everything
- Get result (or error)

---

## After: Knowledgeable Assistant

- Start with your goal
- AI guides what's needed
- Dynamic, contextual assistance
- Perfect results

---

## What This Enables

AI systems that can:
- 🧠 **Think ahead** about needed information
- 🗣️ **Communicate clearly** about requirements
- 🤝 **Collaborate naturally** with humans
- 🎯 **Deliver precise results**

# The Future is Here

---

## MCP Elicitation isn't just a protocol feature

## It's the foundation for the next generation of **AI-human collaboration**

---

## The Vision

AI that **truly augments human capability** rather than replacing it

By requesting exactly the context needed, when needed

---
